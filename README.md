# Code samples from "Dockerizing a ColdFusion Enterprise Application, a Case Study"

ColdFusion Summit 2017, November 16, 2017 1:45 PM - 2:45 PM

>These demos were performed on Windows 10 with Docker Version 17.09.0-ce-win33

**BINARIES NOT INCLUDED**

These files are referenced by the demo code and required for building Docker images but are not included in this distribution:

- ColdFusion_2016_WWEJ_linux64.bin (adobe.com)
- hotfix-004-302561.jar (adobe.com)
- mysql-connector-java-5.1.42-bin (mysql.com)


# Demo 1: Minimal Example

A **minimal** example of building a CF Docker image.

- build the image
- run the container

REQUIREMENTS

- The build requires the Linux x64 ColdFusion installer `ColdFusion_2016_WWEJ_linux64.bin` file to be in the `demo1` folder.

TO BUILD

    cd cfdemo1
    docker build -t cfdemo1 .

FILES OF INTEREST

    Dockerfile
    myapp\index.cfm

TO RUN

    docker run -ti --rm -p 8500:8500 cfdemo1

Test by browsing to http://localhost:8500


## Demo 1: Developer Use Case

Files on the host can be bind mounted to the container using `-v c:\host\path:/container/path`.

RUN DEVELOPER USE CASE

    docker run -ti --rm -p 8500:8500 -v %cd%\myapp:/opt/coldfusion2016/cfusion/wwwroot/myapp cfdemo1

Test by browsing to http://localhost:8500/myapp and modifying files in  `myapp\`.


# Base Image (Required for Demo 2)

A base image used by some of the examples.

TO BUILD

    cd cfbaseos
    docker build -t cfbaseos .


# Demo 2: Real-World Example

A **real-world** example of building a CF Docker image including (everything but the kitchen sink):

- uses a local base image `cfbaseos` to eliminate 3rd party build-time dependencies
- uses multi-stage builds feature and `--squash` to reduce the image size
- automates CF hotfix 4 installation
- automates keytool for certificate installation
- relocate the CF web root to `/var/www` in `server.xml`
- bind mount the projectâ€™s source code `www\` to `/var/www`
- bind mount the CF configuration files `cf\` to their respective locations in the CF directory
- add an NGINX service to the stack which will function as a reverse proxy and a static cache
- use `docker-compose.yml` to define the composition
- use `docker-compose up` command to bring up the stack

REQUIREMENTS

- The following binaries are required for building and should be put in the `cfdemo2\cf-res\software` folder:
  - `ColdFusion_2016_WWEJ_linux64.bin`
  - `hotfix-004-302561.jar`
  - `mysql-connector-java-5.1.42-bin`
- The `cfbaseos` image should be built if it hasn't been already.

TO BUILD

    cd cfdemo2
    docker build --squash -t cfdemo2 .

FILES OF INTEREST

    Dockerfile
    cf\ (neo-*.xml, server.xml, seed.properties, etc.)
    nginx\nginx.conf
    www\
    docker-compose.yml

TO RUN

    docker-compose up

Test by browsing to http://localhost


# Demo 3: Load-balancing with Docker, NGINX, and Redis

Builds on Demo 2 and demonstrates:

- Docker's built-in load-balancer
- builds on the image `cfdemo2` built in Demo 2
- adds a simple layer to the CF image: Redis configuration (in neo-runtime.xml)
- adds a Redis service (scale=1) to the composition using the official Redis image
- configures NGINX (scale=1) to look for 3 CF backends
  - note: the upstream backends defined in `nginx.conf` are based on the way Docker automatically names the containers on the network: `cfdemo3_cf_1`, `cfdemo3_cf_2`, etc.
- scales CF using `docker-compose --scale`
- uses `docker-compose.yml` to define the composition

REQUIREMENTS

- `cfdemo2` image created in Demo 2

TO BUILD

    cd cfdemo3
    docker build -t cfdemo3 .

FILES OF INTEREST

    Dockerfile
    cf\
    nginx\nginx.conf
    www\Application.cfc (enable session mgmt)
    docker-compose.yml

TO RUN

    docker-compose up --scale cf=3

Test by browsing to http://localhost. Note the containers are load balanced (thanks to Docker) and the session id remains the same (thanks to Redis).

A FEW NOTES ABOUT STICKY SESSIONS INSTEAD OF REDIS

You can't use sticky sessions with Docker load-balancing because the back-ends are non-deterministic.
One option is to use NGINX for load-balancing. NGINX can do this by way of the upstream 'ip_hash' directive which by default switches based on client ip. This is a bit tricky though because the client ip gets abstracted by the Docker network NAT. Read more about it here:

https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/180

You can alternatively hash on some other client identifier other than client ip like cftoken for example but it takes at least an initial round trip through the load balancer for new clients to receive a cftoken the first time so in these cases the session may not stick on the first request.
